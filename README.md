# VBA_Word_CBUtilities
This was prompted by the CB Utilities v66 & 67 "seeming" to be a now corrupted file.
Interestingly, I had the ability to create a template with macros, digitally sign it
and run code in the VBA editor with no problem. I need to try loading this new template
as an Add-In and see if it works. If it does, then I can add the modules, classes and forms
to a new digitally signed template with macros.
